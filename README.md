ParticleArtificialChemistry
===========================

A Javascript implementation of Tim Hutton's artificial chemistry model.

This particular branch tries to make replication happen 'uphill' by allowing food to bond to itself. This way, the energy associated with food self-bonding is actually greater than the energy associated with making the food part of the replicator, so it no longer gets a free lunch but rather has to expend energy (or wait for the thermal gradient to expend energy) in order to get access to the food in a usable form.
